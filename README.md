# Matching Game Project

Matching games are games that require players to match similar elements. As the name implies, participants need to find a match for a word, picture, or card.

## Overview

I was using HTML, CSS, JQuery to create simple Matching Game.

## Getting Started

To run game you can download and run ```index.html``` file, or just click [here](https://moramu.github.io/fend-project-memory-game/)

### Instructions

1. Try to remember the symbols!
2. If the symbols match, the cards will stay open. Otherwise, they will close after 4 seconds, or when you click on another card.
3. When all cards are matched, you win the game!

	### Note: 
	- 0-8 moves: 3 star;
	- 9-20 moves: 2 star;
